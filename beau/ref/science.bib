abstract = "In this paper the optimal boundary control problem for diffusion–convection-reaction processes modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) defined on time-dependent spatial domains is considered. The model of the transport system with time-varying domain arises in the context of high energy consuming Czochralski crystal growth process in which the crystal temperature regulation must successfully account for the change in the crystal spatial domain due to the crystal growth process realized by the pulling crystal out of melt. Starting from the first principles of continuum mechanics and transport theorem the time-varying parabolic \{PDE\} describing temperature evolution is derived and represented as a nonautonomous parabolic evolution system on an appropriately defined function space which is exactly transformed in the infinite-dimensional boundary control problem for which a boundary linear quadratic regulator is proposed. Properties of the solution of the time-varying parabolic \{PDEs\} given by the two-parameter evolutionary system are utilized in the synthesis of the optimal boundary regulator, and the control law is applied to the model given by a two-dimensional partial differential equation in the cylindrical coordinates representing the Czochralski crystal growth process with one-dimensional growth direction. Finally, numerical results demonstrate optimal stabilization of the two-dimensional temperature distribution in the crystal. "

A modified accelerated monotone iterative method is presented to solve the finite difference systems for both the time-dependent problem and its corresponding steady-state problem. This method leads to a simple and yet efficient linear iterative algorithm. It yields two sequences of iterations that converge monotonically from above and below, respectively, to a unique solution of the system. The monotone property of the iterations gives concurrently improving upper and lower bounds for the solution. It is shown that the rate of convergence for the sum of the two sequences is quadratic. Under an additional requirement, quadratic convergence is attained for one of these two sequences. In contrast with the existing accelerated monotone iterative methods, our new method avoids computing local maxima in the construction of these sequences. An application using a model problem gives numerical results that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. "

abstract = "Nonstandard finite differences (NSFD) schemes can improve the accuracy and reduce computational costs of traditional finite-difference schemes. However, the development of these schemes is based on analytical solutions and ad hoc rules. In this paper, we derive a \{NSFD\} scheme based on Green's function formulations for reaction–diffusion–convection systems. The formulation of the \{NSFD\} scheme is divided into three stages. In the first one, the domain of the original boundary value problem is decomposed into N subdomains. In the second stage, for each subdomain, integral formulations based on Green's functions are derived for each subdomain. Finally, the resulting integrals are approximated by means of quadrature rules. The proposed \{NSFD\} scheme based on Green's function formulation incorporates, in a natural way, the effects of boundary nodes in the discretization approximation (i.e., avoiding the use of heuristic rules), it also exhibits global approximation orders of O ( h 2 ) and leads to smaller approximation errors with respect to standard \{FD\} schemes. Numerical simulations on a catalytic particle model and a benchmark tubular reactor model are used for illustrating the accuracy and performance of the proposed \{NSFD\} scheme as compared to standard finite differences schemes.

We examine and discuss the effect of transport parameters, reactor inlet boundary condition, and reactor aspect ratio on the dynamics of the system. The results show a variety of regimes going from steady propagation of a reaction front to the development of chemical waves in the form of pulsating, more or less regularly, reaction front. "

abstract = "A reaction–diffusion–convection (RDC) model is introduced as a convenient framework for studying instability scenarios by which chemical oscillators are driven to chaos. Distinct bifurcations in the oscillating patterns are found as diffusion coefficients or Grashof numbers are varied. Singularly there emerge peculiar bifurcation paths in which quasi-periodicity transmutes into a period-doubling sequence to chemical chaos. The opposite influence exhibited by the two parameters in these transitions clearly indicate that diffusion and natural convection are in ‘competition’ for the stability of ordered dynamics: the former has a stabilizing effect while the latter exerts a destabilizing role.
